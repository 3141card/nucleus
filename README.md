This project focuses on PlayStation 3 emulation. Please, understand that I'm not interested on providing support, releases, or attention to any comments, issues or pull requests for now.

### Limitations
* __Memory__: Nucleus emulates the PS3 user-mode environment, which uses 32-bit addresses. This reflects on the CPU / Memory related code, and could cause issues if you use it for other platforms, or for designing a low-level PS3 emulator.
* __Portability__: Nucleus assumes that the host system runs on a low endian CPU, with 64-bit addresses.

### Disclaimer
The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. **It is not for enabling illegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the Internet.
