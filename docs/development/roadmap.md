Roadmap
=======

Some tasks to be done. Order is irrelevant unless explicitly stated:

* `gfx/frontend/opengl`: Implement GLSL shader parser.
* `cpu/hir/passes`: More optimization passes.
* `cpu/frontend/spu`: Take care of unimplemented instructions.
* `gpu/rsx`: Verify on a real console which PGRAPH commands are allowed between a *begin*-*end* pair of `NV4097_SET_BEGIN_END` commands.
